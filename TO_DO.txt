TODO
----

1) Currently Cassandra server and Mongo db servers need to be started initially and separately.
   Change the project configuration such that these servers are started as part of launching the project.
   
2) Modify tests, such that each time appropriate data is populated in the data stores and then removed
   after the testing is done.
